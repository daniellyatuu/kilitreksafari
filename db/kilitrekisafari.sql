(1, 'Machame Route', 'The Machame route, is also known as the “Whiskey” route, This is the most popular route on the mountain. Machame approaches mount kilimanjaro from the southwest and descends using Mweka gate, rewarding climbers with views of the expansive Shira Plateau, an optional scramble up Lava Tower, a climb up the Great Barranco Wall, and a traverse underneath Kilimanjaro’s Southern Icefield. The descent occurs on the Mweka route. Climbers sleep in tents and eat meals either outdoors or inside a large dining tent.\r\nThe 7 day Machame route is highly recommended and used by most prominent Kilimanjaro operators.\r\n\r\nDay 1 : Machame Gate to Machame Camp\r\nThe drive from Moshi to the Mount Kilimanjaro National Park Gate takes about 50 minutes. The journey passes through the village of Machame which is located on the lower slopes of the mountain.\r\n\r\nWe now leave the park gate and walk through the rain forest on a winding trail up a ridge. Lower down, the trail can be muddy and slippery. Gaiters and trekking poles are a good idea here. We continue a short distance until we reach the Machame Camp.\r\n\r\n\r\nDay 2 : Machame Camp to Shira Camp\r\nAfter breakfast, we leave the glades of the rain forest and continue on an ascending path, crossing the little valley walking along a steep rocky ridge, covered with heather, until the ridge ends. The route now turns west onto a river gorge. Time for rest, dinner, and overnight at the Shira campsite.\r\n\r\nDay 3 : Shira Camp to Lava Tower to Barranco Camp\r\nFrom the Shira Plateau, we continue to the east up a ridge, passing the junction towards the peak of Kibo. As we continue, our direction changes to the South East towards the Lava Tower, called the “Shark’s Tooth.” Shortly after the tower, we come to the second junction which brings us up to the Arrow Glacier at an altitude of 16,000ft. We now continue down to the Barranco Hut at an altitude of 13,000ft. Here we rest, enjoy dinner, and overnight. Although you end the day at the same elevation as when you started, this day is very important for acclimatization and will help your body prepare for summit day.\r\n\r\nDay 4 : Barranco Camp to Karanga Camp\r\nAfter breakfast, we leave Barranco and continue on a steep ridge passing the Barranco Wall, to the Karanga Valley campsite. This is a short day meant for acclimatization.\r\n\r\nDay 5 : Karanga Camp to Barafu Camp\r\nAfter breakfast, we leave Karanga and hit the junction which connects with the Mweka Trail. We continue up to the Barafu Hut. At this point, you have completed the South Circuit, which offers views of the summit from many different angles. Here we make camp, rest, enjoy dinner, and prepare for the summit day. The two peaks of Mawenzi and Kibo are to be seen from this position.\r\n\r\nDay 6 : Barafu Camp to Summit to Mweka Hut\r\nVery early in the morning (midnight to 2am), we continue our way to the summit between the Rebmann and Ratzel glaciers. You head in a northwesterly direction and ascend through heavy scree towards Stella Point on the crater rim. This is the most mentally and physically challenging portion of the trek.\r\n\r\nAt Stella Point (18,600 ft), you will stop for a short rest and will be rewarded with the most magnificent sunrise you are ever likely to see (weather permitting). From Stella Point, you may encounter snow all they way on your 1-hour ascent to the summit. At Uhuru Peak, you have reached the highest point on Mount Kilimanjaro and the continent of Africa. Faster hikers will see the sunrise from the summit.\r\n\r\nFrom the summit, we now make our descent continuing straight down to the Mweka Hut camp site, stopping at Barafu for lunch. You will want gaiters and trekking poles for the loose gravel going down. Mweka Camp is situated in the upper forest and mist or rain can be expected in the late afternoon. Later in the evening, we enjoy our last dinner on the mountain and a well-earned sleep.\r\n\r\nDay 7 : Mweka Camp to Moshi\r\nAfter breakfast, we continue the descent down to the Mweka Park Gate to receive your summit certificates. At lower elevations, it can be wet and muddy. Gaiters and trekking poles will help. Shorts and t-shirts will probably be plenty to wear (keep rain gear and warmer clothing handy).\r\n\r\nFrom the gate, a vehicle will meet you at Mweka gate to drive you back to hotel in Moshi', '6 - 7 Days', 'machame.jpg'),
(2, 'Umbwe Route', 'The Umbwe route is known for its caves. The first night you actually sleep at the Umbwe Cave Camp with two more caves that can be visited en route the following day. Because of the high risks involved with sleeping at Arrow Glacier camp and summiting via the Western Breach, all our Umbwe route hikes are re-routed, to join with the Machame route from night 2 on the mountain. On special request we can assist with Umbwe route hikes attempting to summit using the Western Breach / Arrow Glacier path and overnight at the Crater camp. Please note this can only be arranged through our higher quality Standard packages and a supplement rate will apply.\r\n\r\nThe main itinerary difference between the Umbwe 6 day and 7 day routes is the additional acclimatization day at Barranco camp.\r\n\r\nDay 1: Umbwe Gate (1614m) – Umbwe Cave camp (2850m)\r\n\r\nHiking time: 6 Hours\r\nDistance: Approximately 10.3 km\r\nHabitat: Forest (Montane)\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast you will be driven to the Machame gate where registration formalities will be completed. From the Machame gate you will be transferred to the Umbwe Gate (1641m), passing through villages with coffee and banana plantations. The air is thick with moisture and the path is usually muddy. The route initially follows a forestry track winding up through the natural rain forest. It then narrows and steepens to climb the ridge between the Lonzo and Umbwe rivers, with huge trees surrounding you. The path offers some spectacular views of deep gorges and if you are lucky, glimpses of Kilimanjaro towering above you in the distance. The camp is perched between huge trees and thick undergrowth. Enjoy dinner and overnight at the Umbwe Cave Camp (2 850m).\r\n\r\nDay 2 : Umbwe Cave camp (2850m) – Barranco camp (3985m)\r\n\r\nHiking time: 6 hours\r\nDistance: Approximately 6.3 km\r\nHabitat: Moorland\r\n\r\nShortly after leaving the camp the forest starts thinning and is replaced by rockier terrain, sparser undergrowth and straggly, moss-covered trees. The path continues along a narrow, but spectacular ridge. As you gain higher altitude, catch glimpses of Kilimanjaro rising majestically ahead of you – etched against the blue sky. The path flattens as you approach Barranco Valley.\r\nFrom the Umbwe ridge the route descends slightly to the Barranco camp. The camp is situated in the valley below the Breach and Great Barranco Wall, which should provide you with a memorable sunset while your dinner is being prepared.\r\n\r\nDay 3: Barranco camp (3985m) – Karanga Camp (4040m)\r\n\r\nHiking time: 6 hours\r\nDistance: Approximately 6 km\r\nHabitat: Moorland / Semi desert\r\nAfter spending a night at the great Barranco Wall (a very imposing sight at first), you make your way up this awesome looking obstacle, which in the end normally turns out to be easier than anticipated. Topping out just below the Heim Glacier, you will now appreciate just how beautiful Kilimanjaro really is. The route then heads down through the Karanga Valley over intervening ridges and valleys, and then joins up with the Mweka route. This is the preferred route down from the summit, so remember it. The last water stop on the route is the Karanga Valley, as there is no water available at Barafu camp. Enjoy dinner and overnight at the Karanga camp.\r\n\r\nDay 4 : Karanga camp (4040m) – Barafu camp (4681m)\r\n\r\nHiking time: 4 hours\r\nDistance: Approximately 3.4km\r\nHabitat:Alpine desert\r\nBreakfast at Karanga camp and after breakfast turn left up the ridge and the route ascends 640m towards Barafu Camp. Barafu is the Swahili word for “ice” and it is a bleak and inhospitable camping area to spend the night.\r\nTotally exposed to the ever-present gales, the tents are pitched on a narrow, stony, and dangerous ridge.\r\nMake sure that you familiarise yourself with the terrain before dark to avoid any accidents.\r\n\r\nThe summit is now a further 1214m higher and you will commence with your final ascent attempt, the same night. Prepare your equipment, hiking poles and thermal clothing for your summit attempt. This should include the replacement of your headlamp and camera batteries and make sure you have a spare set available as well. To prevent freezing it will be wise to carry your water in a thermal flask. Go to bed as early as possible and try to get some precious rest and sleep.\r\n\r\nDay 5– summit attempt\r\n\r\nBarafu camp (4681m)-Uhuru Peak (5895m)-Mweka (3090m)\r\n\r\nHiking time: 7 to 8 hours to reach Uhuru Peak, 6 to 8 hours to descend to Mweka Camp\r\nDistance: Approximately 4.5 km ascent and 10.8 km descent\r\nHabitat: Stone scree and ice-capped summit\r\nYou will get up around 23h20, and after some tea and biscuits you shuffle off into the night.\r\nYou will head in a north-westerly direction and ascend through heavy scree towards Stella Point on the crater rim.\r\nFor many climbers the 6-hour walk to Stella point is mentally and physically the most challenging on the route.\r\nAt Stella Point (5739m) you will stop for a short rest and will be rewarded with the most magnificent sunrise you are ever likely to see (weather permitting).\r\nFrom Stella Point you will normally encounter snow all the way on your 2-hour ascent to Uhuru Peak.\r\nThe time you will spend on the summit will depend on the weather conditions.\r\nDo not stop here for too long, as it will be extremely difficult to get going again due to cold and fatigue.\r\n\r\nEnjoy your accomplishment and a day to remember for the rest of your life!\r\n\r\nThe walk back to Barafu from the summit, takes about 3 hours.\r\nHere you will have a well earned but short rest and collect the rest of your gear,\r\nbefore heading down to Mweka hut (3090m).\r\nThe route is not difficult and will take you down the rock and scree path into the moorland and eventually into the forest.\r\nThe camp is situated in the upper forest and mist or rain can be expected in the late afternoon.\r\nDinner and washing water will be prepared.\r\n\r\nDay 7 : Mweka camp (3090m) – Mweka Gate (1641m)\r\n\r\nHiking time: 4 to 6 hours\r\nHabitat: Forest\r\nDistance: Approximately 8.5 km\r\n\r\nAfter an early and well-deserved breakfast, it is a short 4 to 6 hour and scenic hike back to the Park gate. Some hikers do experience knee problems which could make the descend longer than planned.\r\n\r\nAt Mweka gate you sign your name and details in a register. This is also where successful climbers receive their summit certificates. Those climbers who reached Stella Point (5739m) are issued with green certificates and those who reached Uhuru Peak (5895m) receive gold certificates.\r\n\r\nFrom the Mweka Gate you drive back to Moshi for a long overdue hot shower, dinner and celebrations!!', '6 - 7 Days', 'umbwe.jpg'),

(4, 'Shira Route', 'The Shira Route is very similar to the Lemosho Route, except that it starts at an already high altitude of 11,800ft/3600m on the Shira Plateau. This can make it slightly more difficult to acclimate properly. The route merges with the Machame route and follows the Southern Circuit. We offer 6, 7 and 8 day treks on Shira route, and recommend 7 or 8 days. This is a nice route, but we prefer Lemosho as it starts lower and you will get to experience the rain forest on the ascent.\r\n\r\nDay 01:\r\nRegister at Londrosi gate and continue driving up to Moram (11,800ft/3,600m), the trek starts on the Shira plateau for a flat and short hike to Shira 1 Camp (11,800ft/3,600m).

(5, 'Marangu Route', 'The Marangu or “Coca-Cola” Route is a relatively easy route up the mountain. Climbers sleep in dormitory style huts and also descend on the Marangu Route, so the scenery is less varied. This route is considered one of the easier routes due to gradual slopes, however acclimatization is more difficult due less days on the mountain. accommodations are in dormitory style huts, so this route is good for the rainy season treks. This route can be climbed in 5 or 6 days. 6 days is recommended.\r\n\r\nDay 01:\r\nRegister at Marangu Gate (6,045ft/1,843m), the climb then starts out in the rain forest of the lower slopes where we may encounter animals, such as black & white colobus monkeys and several varieties of birds.
